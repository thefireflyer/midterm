## Approach

Like with Hanoi's Tower, I started by creating a library component and an application component.

I started by using rust's builtin hash set since I hadn't ported my own to rust yet. Most of the library logic was pretty simple.

I wasn't familiar with Levenshtein distance, so I just went to Wikipedia and read through their documentation. I also found a site called Baeldung that had a pretty good article explaining it as well. After implementing the edit distance function, I kept getting weird looking results, so I checked Wikimedia's rust example implementation (it turned to just be correctly weird).

After getting unit tests to pass on the library, I started working through the CLI. I wanted to use Cursive, an interactive TUI framework, but they didn't have a multi-line text edit component that supported stylized text and I was already running low on time so I went with a simple Clap interface. I also didn't want to have to type in a path every time so I setup a default dictionary search algorithm for Linux machines. I use Arch and I know it works on my machine, but I haven't tested it on other distros. I also haven't had time yet to write a Windows version (I have dual boot so I could in theory test it) and I don't access to a MacOs device so I could write something but I would have no way of knowing if it works. 

## Review

I'm pretty happy with my spell checker. It's not very impressive or interesting, but it works.
