## Approach

I knew beforehand that I wanted to separate the solver and display system, so I set up two skeleton projects to start with.

I then started with a simple 3 peg recursive version and then moved onto the iterative version. The Tower of Hanoi Wikipedia page was helpful as a reference. After I got both iterative and recursive solutions for the 3 peg case, I started working on a general case solution. Here, geeksforgeeks was somewhat helpful as it's 4 peg function helped me decide whether to spread disks out before or after creating an auxiliary stack.

All three algorithms needed a way to reference sections of a mutable array, but I wasn't able to write it in a rust safe way. Instead, I opted to remove the bottom elements of the array and store them in a separate variable. This is less efficient (O(n) versus O(1)), but I had limited time and wasn't making progress with references.

Once I got unit tests passing I started working on the gui. 3d was not a good move. For context, I've used engines like Godot and Unity before and remember feeling pretty confident in them, but I had never used Bevy before. I think some YouTube channel recommended it years ago and when I checked their examples page, everything seemed pretty straight forward. Nope. I mean to be fair, it would've been straight forward if I knew what I was doing, but rushing to learn Bevy's ECS system for the first time as well as UI, animation, event handling and camera systems was not the smoothest experience. Anyway, somehow I got it to mostly work. Bevy does actually have pretty good documentation and resources for the most part, which were incredibly helpful.

There was a weird problem I ran into where I had written all of my animation code as an actual animation (using built-in systems), but I couldn't get the player to find the disks. I honestly still don't know why, but I ended up switching to a custom frame by frame system that just uses lerps for everything.

## Review

Results wise and considering the amount of time I had to complete this, I am actually super happy with I got done. It's far from perfect, the code is a mess, nothing is optimized, there's an annoying animation velocity quirk I couldn't fix, and I'm pretty sure my general case solver isn't actually an optimal solution. However, even just getting functional UI was a relief, let alone animation and event handling.
